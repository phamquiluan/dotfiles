## Chapter 1: Good Writing (pages 1-18)

### Core Message
Good writing is learned by reading good writing and reflecting on what makes it good.

### Key Practices of Good Writers:
1. **Fresh wording over familiar verbiage** - Avoid clichés and stock phrases
2. **Concrete imagery over abstract summary** - Show specific details, not generalizations
3. **Attention to reader's vantage point** - Control where the reader looks
4. **Judicious use of uncommon words** - Against a backdrop of simple nouns and verbs
5. **Parallel syntax** - Pleasingly balanced sentence structures
6. **Occasional planned surprise** - Unexpected transitions, twists
7. **Telling details that obviate explicit pronouncements** - Show, don't tell
8. **Meter and sound that resonate with meaning** - Phonesthetics

### On Word Choice:
- Rules like "never use fancy words" are badly stated
- A skilled writer CAN use uncommon adjectives/adverbs effectively
- **Phonesthetics**: Best words echo meaning in their sound (e.g., "haunting" sounds haunting)
- Use thesaurus carefully: "Do not get carried away with the destructive potential of this tool"
- Avoid words that sound opposite to meaning (e.g., "pulchritude" sounds ugly)

### On Transitions:
- Use surprising transitions: colons, dashes, block quotations
- Writer = cinematographer: manipulates perspective with verbal camera angles and quick cuts

### On Endings:
- **Good writing finishes strong**
- Short, punchy endings can be powerful (e.g., "They left.")
- Single-sentence paragraphs CAN work despite what composition courses say

### The Attitude:
- Writers should not hide passion and relish for their subjects
- Write as if you have something important to **show** (not just say)

## Chapter 2: A Window onto the World (starts page 19)

### Classic Style - The Core Concept
- Guiding metaphor: **seeing the world**
- Writer sees something reader hasn't noticed; orients reader's gaze
- Purpose: presentation; motive: disinterested truth
- Success = clarity and simplicity
- **Prose is a window onto the world**

### Writing is Unnatural:
- Darwin: children speak instinctively but must learn to write
- Speaking vs writing: different human relationships
- Writing is "an act of pretense" - visualize yourself in conversation

### The Key to Good Style:
- Have a clear conception of the make-believe world in which you're pretending to communicate
- Classic style: present truth as if showing reader something they can verify themselves
- The writer knows the truth before putting it into words
- The reader is competent and can recognize truth when shown it
