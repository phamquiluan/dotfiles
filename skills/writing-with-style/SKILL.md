# Writing with Style

Apply these principles from Steven Pinker's "The Sense of Style" to produce clear, engaging prose.

## Classic Style: The Core Philosophy

**Prose is a window onto the world.** The writer has seen something the reader hasn't noticed; the writer orients the reader's gaze so they can see it for themselves.

### The Classic Style Stance:
- **Purpose**: Presentation of truth, not persuasion
- **Motive**: Disinterested truth (even if you have an agenda, don't show it)
- **Writer's role**: Show, don't argue
- **Reader assumption**: Competent, can recognize truth when shown
- **Communication model**: Conversation, not lecture

### What Classic Style Is NOT:
- **Self-conscious style**: Drawing attention to the writing itself
- **Practical style**: Instructions, manuals
- **Contemplative style**: Musing, introspecting
- **Prophetic style**: Oracular pronouncements

## Defeating the Curse of Knowledge

The main cause of bad writing is the difficulty of imagining what it's like for someone who doesn't know what you know.

### Strategies to Break the Curse:
1. **Show a draft to someone** who is like your intended reader
2. **Read aloud** - hear where readers will stumble
3. **Look for jargon** - technical terms you've forgotten are technical
4. **Unpack abstractions** - turn nominalizations back into verbs and specifics
5. **Add examples** - concrete instances of abstract points
6. **Use analogies** - bridge from known to unknown

### Signs You're Cursed:
- Using abbreviations without defining them
- Referring to findings without explaining them
- Assuming background knowledge readers lack
- Chunking information into expert-level units

## Word Choice

### Fresh Over Familiar:
- Avoid clichés and stock phrases
- Seek words that are *telling* - that capture exactly the right nuance
- **Phonesthetics**: Best words echo meaning in their sound
  - Good: "haunting" (sounds haunting)
  - Bad: "pulchritude" (sounds ugly, means beauty)

### When to Use Uncommon Words:
- Against a backdrop of simple nouns and verbs
- When they convey exactly the right meaning
- Not to impress, but to illuminate

### Avoid:
- Metaconcepts: "approach," "assumption," "concept," "condition," "context," "framework," "issue," "level," "model," "perspective," "process," "role," "strategy," "tendency"
- Zombie nouns (nominalizations): "The decision was made" → "We decided"
- Scare quotes around ordinary words
- Hedging for no reason: "somewhat," "rather," "to some extent"

## Sentence Structure

### Put Heavy After Light:
- Light → Heavy (easier to parse)
- Short subjects, longer predicates
- "Susan gave the struggling student who had failed the first exam a passing grade" (hard)
- "Susan gave a passing grade to the struggling student who had failed the first exam" (easier)

### Right-Branching Over Left-Branching:
- **Left-branching** (harder): "The dog the cat the rat bit chased fled"
- **Right-branching** (easier): "The rat bit the cat that chased the dog that fled"

### Managing Complexity:
- Break long sentences into shorter ones
- Use punctuation to signal structure: dashes, colons, semicolons
- Put explanatory material after the main clause, not before

## Coherence: Arcs of Connection

### The Given-New Contract:
1. Start with what the reader knows (given)
2. Add what the reader doesn't know (new)
3. The new becomes given for the next sentence

### Topic and Comment:
- Each sentence has a **topic** (what it's about) and a **comment** (what you say about it)
- Topics should connect from sentence to sentence
- Keep topics consistent through a paragraph

### Coherence Relations:
| Type | Function | Markers |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Elaboration** | Add detail | specifically, in particular, for example |
| **Similarity** | Draw parallel | similarly, likewise |
| **Contrast** | Show difference | but, however, in contrast |
| **Cause-Effect** | Show causation | so, because, as a result |
| **Temporal** | Show sequence | then, later, afterward |

### Use Connectives Wisely:
- Don't overuse "however" and "therefore"
- Let logical connections speak for themselves when clear
- Use connectives when the relation isn't obvious

## Show, Don't Tell

### Telling Details:
- Use concrete specifics that imply the general point
- Don't say someone is "brilliant" — show what they did
- Details should *obviate* the explicit pronouncement

### Examples:
- **Telling**: "The party was boring"
- **Showing**: "People checked their phones every few minutes, and by nine o'clock half the guests had left"

## Endings and Rhythm

### Strong Endings:
- End sentences with the most important word
- End paragraphs with the most important sentence
- **Good writing finishes strong**

### Rhythm:
- Vary sentence length
- Short, punchy sentences for key claims
- Longer sentences for elaboration
- Single-sentence paragraphs CAN work

## Grammar: Rules vs. Myths

### Myths to Ignore:
- "Never split an infinitive" — **Myth**. "To boldly go" is fine
- "Never end a sentence with a preposition" — **Myth**. "That's something I won't put up with"
- "Never begin with a conjunction" — **Myth**. And sometimes it adds punch
- "Never use 'which' restrictively" — **Myth** in practice
- "Passive voice is always wrong" — **Myth**. It has legitimate uses

### When Passive Voice Is Good:
- When the agent is unknown or irrelevant
- When maintaining topic continuity
- When the patient is more important than the agent

### Real Rules Worth Keeping:
- Subject-verb agreement
- Pronoun-antecedent clarity
- Dangling modifiers (fix them)
- Parallelism in lists

## The Writer's Attitude

- Write as if you have something important to **show**
- Don't hide passion for your subject
- Treat the reader as intelligent but uninformed
- Visualize yourself in conversation with the reader

## Quick Checklist

Before finalizing any piece:

1. **Curse of Knowledge**: Will a fresh reader understand this?
2. **Abstractions**: Can any be replaced with concrete examples?
3. **Word Choice**: Any clichés or metaconcepts to cut?
4. **Sentence Flow**: Heavy before light? Left-branching tangles?
5. **Coherence**: Given-new contract honored? Topics consistent?
6. **Endings**: Do sentences and paragraphs end strong?
7. **Rhythm**: Good variation in sentence length?

## Examples of Transformation

### Before (Academese):
"The implementation of the organizational restructuring initiative resulted in the achievement of significant improvements in operational efficiency metrics."

### After (Classic Style):
"After we reorganized, the team worked faster."

---

### Before (Zombie Nouns):
"There was a presentation given by the committee about the documentation of the procedures."

### After:
"The committee presented how we document procedures."

---

### Before (Left-Branching):
"Many of the senior researchers who had worked at the lab for over a decade and who had published extensively in the field's top journals disagreed."

### After:
"Many senior researchers disagreed—those who had worked at the lab for over a decade and published extensively in top journals."
